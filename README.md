# Learn-how-to-build-package-in-R-
This workshop is for people looking to learn how to make their own R packages and learn how to use usethis and devtools for package development. The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., usethis::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.  This workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.
This material was developed using:

Software / package	Version
R	4.0.3
RStudio	1.3.1073
devtools	2.3.2
usethis	1.6.3
tidyverse	1.3.0
rlang	0.4.8
broom	0.7.1
Please install and update all software / packages prior to following along, as otherwise errors may arise.

Toolkit
Single usage functions only need to be used one time in the development process; multiple usage functions are executed as needed. This table only contains functions used in this workshop; there are many other handy functions in devtools and usethis for package development.

Usage	Function	Purpose
Single	usethis::create_package("path/package")	initialize package
usethis::use_mit_license("Your name")	add license
usethis::use_pipe()	add pipe function as a dependency
Multiple	devtools::check()	build package locally and check
devtools::load_all()	load functions in üìÇ R/ into memory
usethis::use_r("function")	create R script for function
usethis::use_package("package")	add package dependency
devtools::document()	build and add documentation

How to develop good R packages by Ma√´lle Salmon

R Package Primer by Karl Broman
Open an R session and submit the following, modified to your desired location. Here, I am creating a package named firstpackage on my desktop. 

usethis::create_package("C:/Users/olivier.bado/Desktop/firstpackage")


Now you have a package! The usethis::create_package function:

Creates a new R project named ralph at your specified location.

Opens the ralph project in a new RStudio session.

Creates the minimal essential files and structure required for R packages.

See the package development cheat sheet for a picture overview of the full file structure.
Optional:

If you are already authenticated, the usethis package has some handy functions to quickly connect your local package to a GitHub repository,


usethis::use_git()     # step 1 ----
usethis::use_github()  # step 2 ----
GitHub is renaming the default branch from master to main. Currently, usethis::use_github() creates a repo with the default branch named master.
For more references on using git / GitHub, see Jenny Bryan‚Äôs Happy Git and GitHub for the useR or Ch 18 in R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

First check
Now that we have a package, let‚Äôs check it. Submitting devtools::check() updates package documentation, builds the package, and submits over 50 checks for metadata, structure, R code, documentation, and more!


devtools::check()
This can take a while to run, depending on how big your package is. It is helpful to run frequently, especially if you are planning on submitting to CRAN. But even for internal packages, it is still good practice.

Our first check results in a single warning - that our package needs a license in the DESCRIPTION file:



To fix this, add the license of your choice. A standard recommendation is the MIT license due to broad permissions.


usethis::use_mit_license("Olivier.bado")
This updates the description file, as well as creates two new license files in your project that you never have to touch.



The DESCRIPTION file automatically populates with some fields from your .Rprofile, which can be modified with usethis::edit_r_profile().
You can go back and complete the remaining description fields later. Re-submit


devtools::check()
and our package is error, warning, and note free.



First function
Create
The compute_corr function is a wrapper for cor.test that produces tidy output for Pearson‚Äôs correlation estimate (along with a p-value) to quantify the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.


compute_corr <- function(data, var1, var2){
  
    # compute correlation ----
    cor.test(
      x = data %>% dplyr::pull({{var1}}),
      y = data %>% dplyr::pull({{var2}})
    ) %>% 
    # tidy up results ----
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    # retain and rename relevant bits ----
    dplyr::select(
      correlation = estimate, 
      pval = p.value
    )
  
}
This function uses tidy evaluation by embracing ({{) unquoted variable names.
Let‚Äôs add the compute_corr function to ralph.


usethis::use_r("compute_corr")
This creates a blank R script named compute_corr.R located in the R/ folder. It is convention that your function name and R script name are the same. Copy and paste the function to the blank R script, and then save.



Execute
Take your function for a test drive with devtools::load_all (‚Äúarguably the most important part of the devtools workflow‚Äù).


devtools::load_all()
This places your function in local memory so that you may tinker and confirm its execution. Let‚Äôs give it a try.


compute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = eruptions, var2 = waiting)

# A tibble: 1 x 2
  correlation      pval
        <dbl>     <dbl>
1       0.901 8.13e-100
Depending on which packages are loaded in your R session, you may have a small hiccup here, which we discuss in the workshop.
Document
Next document the compute_corr function using the Roxygen skeleton. First, place your cursor in the function definition, and then you can add the skeleton two ways:

Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton, or

Cntrl + Alt + Shift + R

You should see this:



where we now have an outline to fill in. Note that the three arguments in our function (data, var1, var2) were automatically detected. Update the documentation as follows:


#' Computes a tidy correlation
#'
#' @param data input data set
#' @param var1 name of variable 1 
#' @param var2 name of variable 2 
#'
#' @return A tibble with the Pearson correlation and the p-value
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' compute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = eruptions, var2 = waiting)
Save your function and submit:


devtools::document()
This did a lot of work for you!



The man folder (short for manual) now contains a file called compute_corr.Rd. This is the documentation for your function; you never edit this manually.

The NAMESPACE now specifies that the package will export the compute_corr function.

Preview the documentation with:


?compute_corr


If you want to modify your documentation, make the changes in the Roxygen skeleton in compute_corr.R, save, and then resubmit devtools::document().

Check
Now submit


devtools::check()
and you‚Äôll see that we have some concerns.



This is because compute_corr depends on functions from other packages, such as:

The pipe function (%>%) from the magrittr package.

The tidy function from the broom package.

The select function from the dplyr package.

The pull function from the dplyr package.

Are any other functions missing from this list?
Dependencies
We can fix these errors, warnings, and notes by specifying the dependencies in the compute_corr function.

1. Package dependencies

To specify a package dependency, the name of the package needs to be listed in the DESCRIPTION file. This can be automatically done for you by submitting


usethis::use_package("broom")
usethis::use_package("dplyr")


2. Functions within packages

There are three ways you can specify required functions within packages.

Use the :: notation within your function, as in broom::tidy (recommended, used in this post).

In the Roxygen section of your function, use @importFrom pkg fun1 fun2 - if you prefer this over using ::.

In the Roxygen section of your function, @import pkg - imports all functions from a package; use sparingly/wisely as this makes your package bulkier.

Special case

The pipe function (%>%) from the magrittr package is a special case. The easiest way to include the pipe is


usethis::use_pipe()  # step 1 ----
devtools::document() # step 2 ----
Here, step 1 creates utils-pipe.R in your R folder and adds magrittr to imports in the DESCRIPTION file; step 2 adds the pipe to your NAMESPACE file.



Now let‚Äôs run the check again:


devtools::check()
Can you diagnose the note(s) this time? What steps would you take to correct it? I‚Äôm saving this for discussion in the workshop. 
  Installing your package
Open a new R session. Install your package from your local directory or GitHub, load your package, and execute your functions.


# install package from local directory ----
devtools::install("C:/Users/olivier.bado/Desktop/ralph")

# or install package from GitHub ----
# devtools::install_github("shannonpileggi/ralph")
Due to GitHub renaming the default branch from master to main, you may need to fiddle with the ref argument in devtools::install_github.

# load package ----
library(ralph)

# execute function ----
compute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = eruptions, var2 = waiting)

# A tibble: 1 x 2
  correlation      pval
        <dbl>     <dbl>
1       0.901 8.13e-100
Summary
I hope you feel empowered to start developing your own packages now! We went through many of these steps one time only; however, in the development process, some of these steps are iterative. Here is a recap of our steps, although your work flow may differ.

Step	How
1. Load development packages.	library(usethis), library(devtools)
2. Create new package.	usethis::create_package("path/package")
3. Optional: Connect to GitHub repo.	usethis::use_git(), usethis::use_github()
4. Check build.	devtools::check()
5. Add license.	usethis::use_mit_license("Your name")
6. Check build.	devtools::check()
7. Create new function.	usethis::use_r("function")
8. Test drive function.	devtools::load_all()
9. Insert Roxygen skeleton.	Menu -> Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton
10. Document package.	devtools::document()
11. Preview documentation.	?function
12. Check build.	devtools::check()
13. Specify package dependencies.	usethis::use_package("package")
14. Specify functions within packages.	package::function
15. Document package.	devtools::document()
16. Check build.	devtools::check()
17. Install package.	devtools::install("path/package"), or
devtools::install_github("user/repo")
Although not explicitly written in these steps, I also recommend restarting R frequently in the development process (Session -> Restart R or Ctrl + Shift + F10) in order to test your package in
